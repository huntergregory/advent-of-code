Consider the puzzle below, which has a character-sensitive input file (that is, spaces and new lines are important in the input).


PUZZLE:
One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:
BEGINNING OF INPUT FILE
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
END OF INPUT FILE

...

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?
